    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <hr />

    <h2>Violin</h2>
    <p>I've been playing the violin since I was 5 years old, taking lessons with a private instructor. Growing up, I 
        participated school orchestras, as well as <a href = "https://necmusic.edu/prep">NEC Prep</a>. 
        I particularly like playing pop songs and chinese folk songs on the violin!

    <h2>Art</h2>
    <p>I enjoy creating all kinds of art - photography, colored pencil drawings, 
        watercolor paintings, crochet, graphic design with photoshop and illustrator, etc. 
        I've participated in art competitions and have won multiple awards. Here are a couple 
        of my favorite pieces:

    <ul>
        <li><p>Watercolor painting of my family on vacation in Washington DC</p>

            <li><p>Photoshop re-imagining of the Killing Eve TV poster if it was made in the 1940s
                with 1940s actresses (my work = left, original = right)</p>
